# 42 Common Core
These projects are the projects I've made during the 2 years I've been in the 42 school in Paris.
Most projects are in C and C++. Some are solo projects other are group projects.
I've added the subject for all the projects, if I want to redo them to exercise.
There are gui/games, sorting algorithm, data structures, threading, mutliprocessing projects etc.
I encourage you to take a look at the subject of each projects.
Most projects have bonuses, I tried to make them all, but some are missing.
